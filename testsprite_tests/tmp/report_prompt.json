You are provided with a test result JSON object named testResult.\nYour job is to **generate report files for user** based on the contents of testResult.\n---\nYou MUST perform the following:\n### Generate Markdown Report\n- Extract all the test cases from testCaseResults.\n- Use this data to generate a standardized **Markdown** test report.\n- Follow the structure of reportTemplate.\n- Use tool \"file.write\" to save this report as a file `testsprite_tests\\testsprite-mcp-test-report.md` in the project directory.\n\n---\nYou must include every test case from testResult, list them one by one.\n---\n### Start generating the following file contents now:\n The full markdown report content (for `testsprite-mcp-test-report.md}`)\n---\n## Markdown Report Format:\n{{ Refer to schema }}\n\nAdditional Requirements:\n- The report must strictly follow the template style grouping (each ### Requirement: has multiple #### Test), each case must be classified under the appropriate requirement.\n- The Description under each Requirement can be automatically generated by combining the component and description of the test case.\n- Cases that cannot be classified should form a separate Requirement.\n\nYou must strictly follow these principles:\n- Field placeholders: use N/A if field does not exist  \n- **Project Name:** Use the project root directory name as the project name (e.g., voiceAgent-jiangzhang). If a .git repository name is available, use that instead.\n- **Version:** Manually check package.json in the project root. If the file exists, extract the version field; otherwise, use N/A.\n- **Code Repo:** Use the project root directory name as the project name (e.g., voiceAgent-jiangzhang). If a .git repository name is available, use that instead.\n- **Date:** 2025-09-08 (IMPORTANT: you must use the exact date string here.)\n- **Prepared by:** TestSprite AI Team\n- **Test Results:** testsprite-mcp-test-report.md\n- **Test Error:** Test cases that have passed do not contain the Test Error field or N/A.\n ",
